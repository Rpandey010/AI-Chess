# Chess-AI

## Overview
**Chess-AI** is a simple chess engine built in JavaScript using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. This project aims to provide users with a chess-playing AI that can be customized for different levels of difficulty. It uses external libraries like **chessboard.js** for the chessboard UI and **chess.js** for game mechanics.

## Features
- Play against the AI as white, with the AI controlling the black pieces.
- Adjustable AI difficulty via search depth customization (Minimax depth).
- Option to watch the AI play against itself.
- Real-time game evaluation displayed through an advantage bar.
- Interactive UI with drag-and-drop functionality for moving pieces.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for the AI logic.
- **Chessboard.js**: Library for rendering the chessboard and managing user interactions.
- **Chess.js**: Handles game rules, move validation, and board state.
- **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: The core AI logic for decision-making.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application for consistent environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: For Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).
